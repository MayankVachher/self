A personal landing page that refuses to be a personal landing page.

## Why

Every developer portfolio looks the same. Gradient blobs. Floating cards. Smooth animations that exist because someone saw them on Dribbble. Dark mode with purple accents. "Passionate problem solver" in the hero section.

This isn't that.

## Philosophy

**Quietly loud.** The brutalist aesthetic isn't about being aggressive - it's about having presence without performing. Bold typography. Hard edges. Black and white with a single accent. The design doesn't try to impress. It just presents information with confidence and gets out of the way.

**Organized chaos.** A bento grid that feels intentional but not rigid. Random taglines because a person isn't reducible to one phrase. A mouthless favicon that says everything by saying nothing.

**Radically simple.** One HTML file. No frameworks. No build steps. No npm install. If you can do it in one file, you should. Open it in a browser. Refresh to see changes. Deploy by copying a file. The web doesn't have to be complicated.

## Run it

Open `index.html`.

## Deploy it

Put it anywhere. It's just a file.
